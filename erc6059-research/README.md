## Use Cases
## 1. Composite NFTs:

Bundled assets: Imagine an NFT representing a virtual land parcel. Using ERC-6059, this land NFT could hold child NFTs representing resources like minerals, buildings, or crops within the land, creating a composite NFT. This allows for efficient ownership and transfer of bundled digital assets.
Curated collections: An art gallery could issue an NFT for a curated collection, where the parent NFT holds child NFTs representing individual artworks within the collection. This facilitates collection management and potentially fractional ownership of the entire collection.
## 2. Gamified NFTs:

Evolving characters: In a game, an NFT representing a character could hold child NFTs for its equipment, skills, or experience points. This enables players to customize and evolve their characters through acquiring and managing child NFTs.
In-game assets: An NFT representing a spaceship in a space exploration game could hold child NFTs for its modules, weapons, or resources. This allows players to strategize and manage their spaceships through the ownership and interaction with child NFTs.
## 3. Decentralized Organizations (DAOs):

Membership management: A DAO could issue an NFT to represent membership, where the parent NFT holds child NFTs for voting rights or access to specific DAO features. This enables flexible membership management within the DAO structure.
Delegated voting: Members of a DAO could hold child NFTs representing delegated voting rights from other members. This allows for flexible voting mechanisms within the DAO, enabling members to delegate their voting power.
## 4. Supply Chain Management:

Trackable components: A complex product like a car could have a parent NFT representing the entire car, holding child NFTs for its individual components (engine, wheels, etc.). This facilitates transparent tracking of components throughout the supply chain.
Certification and provenance: Each child NFT could hold information about the origin, certification, and ownership history of its corresponding component, enabling verifiable provenance for the entire product.
## 5. Real-world Asset Fractionalization:

Shared ownership: An NFT representing a piece of real estate could hold child NFTs representing fractional ownership shares. This allows for dividing ownership of the real estate asset into smaller, more accessible units.
Dynamic management: The parent NFT could hold information about the underlying asset and its management, while child NFTs represent individual ownership shares. This enables efficient management of the fractionalized asset and potential voting rights for share holders.
